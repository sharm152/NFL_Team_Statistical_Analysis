Questions asked:
- Do passing yards or rushing yards contribute to more points being scored?
- Are more first downs gained through the air or on the ground? Does gaining more first downs translate to more wins, on average, throughout the regular season?
- Should defenses expect to face teams that are more efficient at throwing the ball or running the ball?
- Over the past three seasons, have more teams prioritized calling pass plays or run plays on offense?

Arguments made:
- Offenses should prioritize pass-heavy over run-heavy game plans to have a better chance of winning more games.
- Defenses should expect and prepare for more pass-focused offenses throughout the regular season.
